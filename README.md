Pywal. PYWAL. Pywal+hyprland // Pywal+bspwm.

# Contents:
## Sublime-text
I have a script (borrowed from https://github.com/Brychlikov/pywal_sublime) which applies the pywal colorshame to the sublime config.
Extraction from the original README:
**Usage:**
  1. Clone/download the repo
  2. (Optional) Copy ```pywal_sublime.py``` somewhere in your ```$PATH```
  3. Add the folowing line to ```~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/User/Preferences.sublime-settings```:
  ```"color_scheme": "Packages/User/PyWal.sublime-color-scheme"```
  or choose the "PyWal" Color Scheme in GUI
  4. Select an adaptive UI theme
  5. Run ```pywal_sublime.py``` whenever you run ```wal``` eg. by using the ```wal -o``` flag

## Chameleon
(Took from GideonWolfe (I <3 u) from [here](github.com/GideonWolfe/Chameleon)

Applies the pywal colorsheme to various applications and most important, it creates a GTK theme & icon pack with the same colorsheme
Didn't touch much the config, I probably should.
